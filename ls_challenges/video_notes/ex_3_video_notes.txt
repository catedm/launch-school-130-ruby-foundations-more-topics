Problem Solving Steps:
  - read and understand the description and requirements
  - scan the test suite and plan out your first phase of implementation to solve the simplest requirements
  - based on the algorithm given, choose your data structure - what's the most advantageous way to represent the data for this problem?
  - identify a few 'problem solving patterns' that you can use.
    - is part of the problem calling for a Regex solution?
    - is there a map or reduce somewhere?
    - should you iterate over an array?
  - write your implementation (and make the tests pass if there are tests)
  - satisfy the next batch of requirements until all tests pass
  - refactor if necessary
