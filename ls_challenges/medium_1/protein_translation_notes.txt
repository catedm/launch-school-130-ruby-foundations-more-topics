RNA: "AUGUUUUCU" => translates to

Codons: "AUG", "UUU", "UCU"
=> which become a polypeptide with the following sequence =>

Protein: "Methionine", "Phenylalanine", "Serine"

input: string
output: array of strings
rules:
  - rna can be broken into three nucleotide sequences called codons
  - there are STOP codons
    - when STOP codons are hit, execution stops
  - if 1 sequence is encountered

    Codon 	            Protein
    AUG 	              Methionine
    UUU, UUC 	          Phenylalanine
    UUA, UUG 	          Leucine
    UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG 	Serine
    UAU, UAC 	          Tyrosine
    UGU, UGC 	          Cysteine
    UGG 	              Tryptophan
    UAA, UAG, UGA 	    STOP

algorithm:
  - split rna sequence into 3's (use each_slice)
  - iterate over resulting array checking elements against codon data structure
  - build resulting sequence during the iteration
  - call uniq on resulting array
